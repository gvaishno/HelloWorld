## What :question:
we are a bunch of students(!:alien:) who are interested in computer science and coding, our goal is to provide a kickstart to students who are interested in Computer Science and coding in general with building something cool and useful. Everyone is welcome to join even if you are not a Computer Science student, we think everyone can contribute and something to everyone. The only prerequisite is your interest in computer science, coding and willingness to share your knowledge with others.

## Why :question:
We thought it would be interesting to communicate with all the computer science enthusiasts around us and build something cool and learn new things from people around us. we believe in learning by building or breaking stuff.

## How :question:
we have a gitter chatroom to communicate, everyone is welcomed, ask questions about stuff. someone will help you out or guide you to a proper direction. you can plan or propose a project with other group members and work on it. get help from everyone when stuck somewhere.

`keep in mind that we have few chatroom rules so read those before asking questions`
